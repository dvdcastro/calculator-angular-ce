# Calculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

It provides a calculator custom element with no view encapsulation oriented towards using it with a Bootstrap using page.

## Packaging

This will create a package called `ce.js` which will be able to be used with an HTML script tag.
```
npm run build && npm run package
```

## Custom element usage

```html
<calc-main></calc-main>
<script src="ce.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
```

## Development server
